# uw_wx_dash
Dash app that pulls University of Washington Department of Atmospheric Sciences rooftop weather station data and plots it. The app also uses the OpenWeather API to pull current and forecast weather data.
<h1>University of Washington Atmospheric Sciences rooftop and Seattle Weather Dash app!</h1>
<p>This app was made so I could practice Dash applications and also make a fun useful tool that grabbed local weather data.</p>
<p>To use, download everything and install the requirements.txt, probably in a virutal environment using Python=3.6.5. 
 Sign up for an Openweather API key and go into the "secrets.ini" file and replace the {Your API key here} tag with your API key.</p>
 <p>In the future, I may try to deploy this app, but currently I don't have time to work out the deployment bugs!</p>
